## Getting Help
If you have questions, issues, or want to know how best to contribute, you can create an issue in this repo.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/relativitydev/containership/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/relativitydev/containership/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, open a pull request.

## Style guide

[golanglint-ci](https://golangci-lint.run/) will run for every PR commit. If there are linting failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.

## Setting up your environment

The easiest and fastest way to get your environment up and running is to use the include DevContainer with Visual Studio Code. [Here is a guide to get started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial).

If you wish to set up an environment manually, please follow [Operator SDK's installation guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/installation/).
